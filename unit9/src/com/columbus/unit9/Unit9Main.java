//Inheritance - build a hierarchy of classes that share characteristics.

//Superclass - parent
//Subclass - child

//Reasons

//Code reusability
//High level classes can be used in many situations.

//Prevent repeating code
//Common methods and variables are all in one place

//Organization
//Organized structure in your classes allows for easy identification.
//Also easier error correction

//Ease of maintenance
//When you want to change something you can easily find it.
//It is also faster to make changes if you only have to do it once in the parent class
